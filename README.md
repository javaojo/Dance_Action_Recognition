# Dance_Action_Recognition
Dance recognition using LSTM model from TensorFlow Keras

Using OpenCV, Keras, Mediapipe, sklearn and etc.

The program can be dynamically trained to learn new dance movements and produce a new LSTM model that can recognise new actions added and recognise a sequence of actions as part of a particular dance routine.
